        <h1>Hi! I'm <strong>{{ .Site.Params.author }}</strong> and I'm a rising senior at Smith College.</h1>
        <h3>I'm a double major in Statistical & Data Sciences (SDS) and Government. I'm primarily interested in applying data science to topics in public policy and political science. I also like to think about ways data scientists can make our work ethical and equitable.</h3>
        <h3>Outside of the classroom, I enjoy rock climbing and trying new ramen restaurants in every city that I visit. When I'm not being active, I'm probably working on a knitting project and watching my favorite TV shows or a good documentary. </h3>
