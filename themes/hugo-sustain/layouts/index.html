        <h1>Hi! I'm <strong>{{ .Site.Params.author }}</strong>.</h1>
        <h3>I'm a 2020 graduate of Smith College, where I double majored in Statistical & Data Sciences (SDS) and Government. As of June 2020, I am an Applied Data Scientist at Civis Analytics, where I work with public sector clients to leverage data for public policy work. I find it important to think critically about ways data scientists can ensure our work is ethical, equitable, and making this world a better place.</h3>
        <h3>In my free time, I enjoy working on women's sports analytics projects, particularly women's soccer.</h3>
        <h3>Outside of data science, I enjoy rock climbing and trying new ramen restaurants in every city that I visit.</h3>
