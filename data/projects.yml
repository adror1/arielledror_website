We used the cosponsorships of bills in the Senate during the 115th Congress (2017-2018) to model partisanship and cosponsorship patterns based on demographic factors of the senators. My group presented this work at the ASA's Women in Statistics and Data Science Conference (October 2019). I continued to work on this project as an independent study in the Government department for subsequent semesters.
