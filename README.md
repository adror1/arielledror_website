## Arielle Dror's Personal Website

This website was built using the `blogdown` R package and [Hugo Sustain Theme](https://github.com/nurlansu/hugo-sustain#features). I set everything up following these tutorials by [Alison Presmanes Hill](https://alison.rbind.io/post/up-and-running-with-blogdown/) and [Yihui Xie, Amber Thomas, and Alison Presmanes Hill](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/). It took a little bit of extra work to get it to work on my end, primarily, making sure that my webpage was compatible with the latest version of Hugo. I also referenced [this post](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2017/04/11/netlify-plus-hugo-0.20-and-beyond/) from Netlify for help on that matter.  

Big thanks to [Professor Albert Kim](http://rudeboybert.rbind.io/) for his help and for convincing me that it was more worthwhile to host on Netlify than Github Pages.
